EchoSafe: AI-Powered Scam Voiceprint Detection Platform
🔒 Protecting financial institutions and their customers from voice-based fraud in real time.

🚀 Project Overview
EchoSafe is a full-stack, AI-driven platform designed to help banks and organizations detect and stop scam calls before they cause harm. Built during the Spring 2025 St. John’s University ACM x Headstarter Hackathon, EchoSafe combines secure audio processing, voiceprint fingerprinting, and intelligent search capabilities to identify known scammers quickly and accurately.

The system securely processes .mp3 and .wav recordings, generates unique voice fingerprints using AI algorithms, and compares them against a database of previously identified scammer profiles. If a match is found, EchoSafe instantly flags the call, providing early warnings that can save financial institutions — and their customers — from costly fraud attempts.
