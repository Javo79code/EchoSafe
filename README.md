# **Echo Safe: AI Scam Voiceprint Database**  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
- During Spring 2025 St. John's Hackathon, we built an AI system that helps banks detect scam phone calls.
- It listens to voice recordings, creates a special fingerprint for each voice, and checks if it matches known scammers.
- If it finds a match, it alerts the bank right away to prevent fraud.
